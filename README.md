# model-wom-USA-IPK
a model of word-of-mouth 

# prerequires

This model runs under Netlogo 5.1 


#Â generate other networks 

networks in this model represent the structure of interactions, which has a huge influence on the dynamics simulated. 

You can easily genarate novel graphs to use using R/igraph.
